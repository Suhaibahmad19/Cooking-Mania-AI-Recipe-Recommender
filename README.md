## Project Overview

This project is an AI-based recipe recommendation system that suggests recipes based on user-input ingredients. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like lemmatization, cosine similarity, and manual TF-IDF computation to process recipes and recommend the most relevant options. It also includes K-Means clustering for grouping recipes into categories.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.8 or later**
2. **Google Colab** (if running the project in the cloud) or a local environment such as Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Git** (for pulling the repository).
4. Required Python libraries:
   - `numpy`
   - `nltk`
   - `math`

## Setup Instructions

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the repository by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

### Setting up the Environment

1. Open the project folder in your local machine or Google Colab.

2. Install the required Python packages. Use the following command to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy nltk
   ```

3. Mount your Google Drive (if using Colab) by adding the following code snippet to your script:

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

4. Download the `recipes.csv` file and place it in your Google Drive or local folder at the specified path in the code.

5. Ensure the file paths in the script match the actual file locations.

### Running the Project

1. Open the main Python file (or notebook) that contains the code.
2. Run the script to preprocess the data and compute TF-IDF values:

   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

3. Use the provided `get_recommendations` function to enter ingredients and retrieve recipe suggestions.
4. Explore the K-Means clustering by modifying the `k` value to adjust the number of clusters.

---

## Usage

- Modify the `user_input` variable to test different ingredients.
- Run the `get_recommendations` function to see recipe recommendations based on cosine similarity.
- Experiment with the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze recipe groups.

## Suggestions for Improvements

We encourage contributions to improve this project. Some ideas include:

1. **Improve TF-IDF Computation**:
   - Implement a more efficient library-based solution such as `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn`.

2. **Add a Web Interface**:
   - Create a user-friendly web application using frameworks like Flask, Django, or Streamlit.

3. **Enhance Clustering**:
   - Visualize clusters using libraries like `matplotlib` or `seaborn`.
   - Integrate additional features for clustering, such as recipe ratings or preparation time.

4. **Dataset Expansion**:
   - Add more recipes and metadata to improve recommendation quality.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize the code for large datasets.

6. **Additional Features**:
   - Include filters for dietary preferences, cuisines, or health metrics.
